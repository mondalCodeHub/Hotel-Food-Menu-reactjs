# About this project
Menu cards can include information about the restaurant's cuisine. Menu cards, whether through menu design or the presentation of food items, can directly inform customers about the quality, origin, and ingredients of the food available at the hotel.

# Purpose of this project
This project is part of my React learning process from the scratch. This is a very simple project to help me brush up on my skills and prerequisite knowledge before diving into a large real-world application. The complexity of the react projects in this repository will grow as the days pass. ``#React03-2022``
